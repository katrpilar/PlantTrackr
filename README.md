## About

PlantTrack was built to help you have a green thumb when it comes to your indoor plants by allowing you to add/create/edit/delete plants from your 'greenhouse' and save detailed care instructions for each.
PlantTrack also allows the user to create plant 'status updates' for events like watering, moving, repotting, etc.
